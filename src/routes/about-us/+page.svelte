		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>
			You are travelling, you arrive in a new town. 
			So how do you get around? 
			Where do you get tickets for regional public transport?
		</p>
		<p>
			While many transport companies have introduced digital services for ticket purchases, these are often fragmented and every organisation offers their own app.
			This is where Kebus helps. While it doesn't sell tickets, it helps you finding the available ticket apps in your area.
		</p>
		<p>Kebus is a work in progress. Germany alone has over 40 transport associations and to cover all will take time and help. If you find apps or regions missing, <a href="mailto:public+kebus@danielsenff.de">let me know</a> and I will add them.</p>
